# FreeAPI: Build an Authentication App

**Cohort**: Web Dev Cohort 2026
**Timeline**: Start: 2 May 2026, 8:00 pm | Due: 6 May 2026, 11:59 pm

## Description
In this project, you will build a simple authentication-based application using HTML, CSS/Tailwind, and JavaScript.

Your task is to use the FreeAPI Authentication Module and implement a complete auth flow on the frontend.

You are expected to build this preferably using vanilla JavaScript. If you want to use React, that is allowed, but JavaScript is preferred for this project.

## API Endpoints To Use

**Register User**
`POST https://api.freeapi.app/api/v1/users/register`
Use this endpoint to allow a new user to create an account.
Required body:
```json
{
  "email": "user.email@domain.com",
  "password": "test@123",
  "role": "ADMIN",
  "username": "doejohn"
}
```

**Login User**
`POST https://api.freeapi.app/api/v1/users/login`
Use this endpoint to allow registered users to log in and receive an authenticated session.
Required body:
```json
{
  "password": "test@123",
  "username": "doejohn"
}
```

**Logout User**
`POST https://api.freeapi.app/api/v1/users/logout`
Use this endpoint to log the user out and clear the active session.

**Get Current User**
`GET https://api.freeapi.app/api/v1/users/current-user`
Use this endpoint to show the details of the currently logged-in user.

## What To Build
Your application should include:
- Register screen or form
- Login screen or form
- Logout button
- Current user profile/details section
- Proper success and error messages
- Clean UI using CSS or Tailwind
- Basic loading states while API requests are running

The goal is to understand how frontend authentication works with API requests, sessions, cookies, and logged-in user state.
